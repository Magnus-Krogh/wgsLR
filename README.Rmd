# `wgsLR`: Shotgun sequencing for human identification: Dynamic SNP marker sets and likelihood ratio calculations accounting for errors

Please refer to the online documentation at <https://mikldk.github.io/wgsLR>, including the vignettes.


## A few small examples

### Estimating the genotype error probability, $w$

```{r}
cases <- wgsLR::sample_data_Hp(n = 1000, w = 0.1, p = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.5))
tab <- table(cases$X_D, cases$X_S)
tab
w_mle <- wgsLR::estimate_w(tab)
w_mle
```

### Calculating likelihood ratios ($LR$'s)

Errors possible and non-matching genotypes:

```{r}
LR_contribs <- wgsLR::calc_LRs(xs = c(0, 0, 2, 2), 
                               xd = c(1, 0, 2, 2), 
                               w = 0.001, 
                               p = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.5))
LR_contribs
prod(LR_contribs)
```
